      I am a Front-end developer based in Munich, Germany. I enjoy helping
      designers and companies bring their ideas into real life. I am looking
      forward to continuing my developer career with a job in a junior web
      developer position. My ability to solve complex problems and my passion
      for programming make me a valuable member for your team.
